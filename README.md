# python-project-folder-generator

This is a simple Python script that can be used to create starting files and folders useful for larger Python projects. 

To run, place run_generator.py into the directory that you want your files to be generated. This script was meant to be used
in tandem with Git. Ideally, run_generator.py would be used in a Git repository that has just been initialized.

Note that the script does not overwrite or generate duplicate files or folders if they already exist in the present directory.
